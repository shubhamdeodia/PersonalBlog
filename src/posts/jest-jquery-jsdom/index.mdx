excerpt: In this post, I will show you, How you can globally configure Jest test runner to work with JSDOM and Jquery
---

If you are testing any Jquery component in an NodeJs environment. You might have came across an issue with Jquery which looks like this:

<br />
<span class="js-error">Error: jQuery requires a window with a document</span>
<br />

You can resolve this issue, In one of the following two ways

1. Create a mock function - for mthods calls made to Jquery.
2. Instantiate Jquery with a document object - globally in your test environment

In this post, we will talk about the second approach. To use this appraoch we will have to make use of [JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) - which is nothing but a implemention of DOM and HTML standards that can be used with Node.js.


First, let's install all the required dependencies

```
npm install -D jest jsdom jquery
```

Second, configure Jest to execute a setup file before running any tests.

Create a folder `test` in your root directory and inside that folder create a file called `jest-pretest.js`

Add a new key `Jest` (if not already present), and inside that key, create a new key `setupFiles` which is an array of absolute path of files which you want to treat as setup files.

```json
//package.json

"jest": { 
    "setupFiles": [
        "<rootDir>/test/jest-pretest.js"
    ]
}
```

Now, inside `jest-pretest.js`, we will setup our jest environment to use JSDOM and Jquery

```js
const jsdom = require("jsdom");
const { JSDOM } = jsdom;

//destructure window object from JSDOM
const { window } = new JSDOM(`<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>
</head><body></body></html>`, {
    contentType: "text/html",
    includeNodeLocations: true,
    resources: "usable",
    storageQuota: 10000000,
    runScripts: "dangerously"
});

const $ = require('jquery')(window);

global.window = window
global.document = window.document

global.jQuery = $
global.$ = $
```

Notice, In the above code, we are only resolving Jquery after we have resolved JSDOM and extracted the window object.

And the way we resolve Jquery is we pass the window object to returning function provided by Jquery.

Now, you are all set to use Jquery in an Nodejs env.
